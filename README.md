all binaries must be executed as superuser

keeps special characters in a single database named _.db ( #, *, &, etc.)

will edit populate_db() function to exclude desired directories. (maybe with config.toml)

lots of files created and removed in a small amount of time in Linux. Will solve the issue

searching with path will be implemented!
