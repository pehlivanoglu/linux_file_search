all binaries must be executed as superuser

keeps special characters in a single database named _.db ( #, *, &, etc.)

DONE -- will edit populate_db() function to exclude desired directories. (maybe with config.toml) --is done with default setup type

lots of files created and removed in a small amount of time in Linux. Will solve the issue

## OPTIMIZATION
will speed up(optimize) setup.rs. (checking if condition is true or false in every iteration in populate_db function)

VACUUM will be used for db optimization

Use EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN

Use Full-Text Search in sqlite

reindexing periodically

use file system monitoring tools (like inotify on Linux)
